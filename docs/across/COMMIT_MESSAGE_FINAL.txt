feat: Complete Across Protocol V3 integration for cross-chain transfers

Implements comprehensive cross-chain token transfer functionality via Across Protocol V3
with NAV integrity preservation and three operational modes.

## Core Components

### Adapter (AIntents.sol)
- Initiates cross-chain transfers on source chain
- Manages virtual balances for NAV integrity
- Supports native currency wrapping
- Uses SafeTransferLib for token operations
- Implements custom errors for gas efficiency

### Extension (EAcrossHandler.sol)
- Handles incoming transfers on destination chain
- Verifies caller is Across SpokePool (critical security)
- Validates token price feeds before accepting
- Processes three transfer modes
- Stores acrossSpokePool as immutable for gas savings

## Features

### Three Transfer Modes

1. **Transfer Mode** - NAV-neutral transfers
   - Creates positive virtual balance on source (offsets sent tokens)
   - Creates negative virtual balance on dest (offsets received tokens)
   - Net result: NAV unchanged on both chains
   
2. **Rebalance Mode** - Performance transfers with verification
   - NAV changes naturally on source
   - Verifies dest NAV within tolerance of source NAV (accounting for spread)
   - Normalizes NAV across different decimals
   - Requires prior sync between chain pairs

3. **Sync Mode** - Chain synchronization
   - Records NAV spread between chains
   - Enables future rebalancing
   - Performed once per chain pair
   - Tokens transferred but no virtual balances created

### Storage

Added ERC-7201 namespaced storage slots:
- `_VIRTUAL_BALANCES_SLOT` - Per-token virtual balances (int256)
- `_CHAIN_NAV_SPREADS_SLOT` - Per-chain NAV spreads (int256)

Both slots asserted in MixinStorage.sol constructor.

### Security

- Handler MUST verify msg.sender == acrossSpokePool
- Price feed validation for all received tokens
- Rebalance mode enforces NAV tolerance limits
- Extensions/adapters only callable via delegatecall
- Used custom errors throughout for gas efficiency

## Testing

### Unit Tests (test/extensions/AcrossUnit.t.sol)
- 15 tests covering all core functionality
- Component deployment and configuration
- Message encoding/decoding
- NAV normalization logic
- Tolerance calculations
- Security checks (unauthorized caller rejection)
- Fuzz tests for edge cases
- ✅ All tests passing

### Fork Tests (test/extensions/AcrossIntegrationFork.t.sol)
- 13 tests for cross-chain integration
- Contract configuration verification
- Virtual balance storage and NAV impact
- Cross-chain transfer flow simulation
- Selector and interface matching
- ✅ All tests passing

## Documentation

### Updated Guidelines
- CLAUDE.md: Added testing requirements, custom errors, doc file management
- AGENTS.md: Added testing checklist, custom errors, security updates

### Across Integration Docs (/docs/across/)
- IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md - Current status and completion checklist
- README.md - Overview with transfer modes explained
- KNOWN_ISSUES_AND_EDGE_CASES.md - Edge cases and limitations
- Multiple implementation guides and summaries

## Known Limitations

### Token Recovery
- Across V3 lacks direct recovery for unfilled deposits
- speedUpV3Deposit is unsafe (can't verify if deposit was filled)
- **Mitigation**: Use reasonable fillDeadline (5-30 minutes)
- **Impact**: Rare with proper parameters (Across fills in seconds)

### External Returns
- If Across returns tokens externally, they're not NAV-excluded
- Documented as known edge case

### Chain Synchronization
- Vaults deployed at different times have different initial NAVs
- Sync mode records spread between chains
- Required once per chain pair for rebalancing
- Client should sync all chains when vault created on new chain

## Breaking Changes

None - This is a new feature addition.

## Migration Guide

No migration needed for existing pools. New functionality is opt-in via:
1. Deploy EAcrossHandler per chain
2. Deploy ExtensionsMap with handler selector
3. Whitelist AIntents in Authority (governance vote)
4. Upgrade pool implementation if needed (governance vote)

## Dependencies

- Across Protocol V3 SpokePool contracts (already deployed)
- Existing Rigoblock infrastructure (Authority, Registry, Factory)
- SafeTransferLib for token operations
- StorageLib for pool storage access

## Gas Optimizations

- Immutable storage for chain-specific addresses
- Transient storage for reentrancy guard
- Minimal storage reads/writes
- Batch token conversions to base token
- Single approval pattern (approve/reset in same tx)

## Future Improvements

- Monitor Across for native recovery mechanisms
- Consider implementing partial fills if supported
- Multi-hop transfers if beneficial
- Further gas optimizations based on usage patterns
